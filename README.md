# Real-Time AR Cube Projection with ArUco Markers

This project implements a real-time **Augmented Reality (AR)** system that detects **ArUco markers** from a webcam feed and projects a virtual **3D cube** onto each detected marker.  
It manually handles camera calibration, pose estimation, and 3D projection using **OpenCV** and **NumPy**, providing a deeper understanding of AR without a 3D game engine.
