### Real-Time AR Cube Projection with ArUco Markers

This project demonstrates a real-time Augmented Reality (AR) system that detects ArUco markers in a webcam feed and projects a virtual 3D cube onto each detected marker.
It manually handles camera calibration, pose estimation, and 3D projection using OpenCV and NumPy, offering a deeper understanding of AR fundamentals without relying on a game engine like Unity.
